# Project_4 ‚Äì Renewable Energy Simulation and Optimization (Wind, Hybrid, and Marine)

This repository contains all code and data used for Project 4 in ENGIN 480, which involves simulating and optimizing the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of offshore wind farms using PyWake and TopFarm.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- Python scripts for AEP simulation (`.py`)
- TopFarm optimization scripts for each wind farm
- `.geojson` files for layout and boundaries (from SeaImpact)
- `.lib` files from Global Wind Atlas for wind speed and direction
- Output folders (e.g., `_TopFarm_out`) with convergence data and plots

## üå¨Ô∏è Wind Farms Included

1. **Vineyard Wind**
2. **Revolution SouthFork Wind**
3. **Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind**
4. **Yunlin Wind**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.11 (via Anaconda)
- [PyWake](https://github.com/TopFarm/PyWake)
- [TopFarm](https://github.com/TopFarm/TopFarm2)
- NumPy, matplotlib, pyproj
- VSCode + GitHub for version control

## üåÄ Simulation Workflow (Delivery 1)

1. Load turbine layout and boundary from `.geojson`
2. Convert coordinates to UTM
3. Parse Weibull distribution values from `.lib`
4. Simulate AEP using PyWake
5. Plot layout with AEP result

## üîß Optimization Workflow (Delivery 2)

1. Use same wind farm data and site model
2. Treat turbine (x, y) as design variables
3. Optimize AEP with TopFarm (using spacing and boundary constraints)
4. Track results with `TopFarmListRecorder`
5. Plot convergence and optimized layout

## üåä Hybrid & Marine Energy (Deliveries 3 and 4)

### üõ∞Ô∏è Delivery 3: Hybrid Energy Simulation (HyDesign)

This part of the project explores hybrid energy systems using the HyDesign platform. The goal was to simulate a mix of wind, solar, and battery systems. We cloned the HyDesign repository and used Streamlit to run the interface. Changes were made to the system configuration (like battery size and generation sources), and the effects were explained in the report. The final setup was tested, and meaningful results were visualized.

### ‚öì Delivery 4: Marine Energy Simulation (WEC-Sim)

For this delivery, we used MATLAB and WEC-Sim to simulate a two-body wave energy converter (a float and a spar). The simulation included hydrodynamic data from BEMIO and post-processing of force and motion plots. Modifications included changes to wave height, wave period, and PTO damping. The results were used to evaluate how the device responds under different sea conditions. A 3D animation confirmed the device‚Äôs behavior matched expected physics.


## üìå Notes

- Each wind farm has its own standalone simulation and optimization script.
- All simulations use the SG 8.0-167 DD turbine and the Bastankhah wake model.
- This repo is organized to make each part reusable, testable, and modular.
